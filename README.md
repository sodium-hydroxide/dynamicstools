# Dynamics Tools
These are a set of tools in python for viewing discrete dynamical systems. These include Poincare maps for sinusoidally driven systems, stochastic difference equations, and other maps. Included are tools for viewing phase portraits and the time series for a solution.

These tools currently require numpy and matplotlib.
